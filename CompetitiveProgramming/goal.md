# Competitive Programming Roadmap

*Start Date:* 04/04/2021  

*End Date:* 04/04/2022

### **Objective** 
- Join a network of Competitive Programmers
- Participate in _ Competitive Programming events

### **Assumption** 
Having joined HubSpot in January 2021, I am excited about contributing in a professional setting. ***I believe my contributions at work have been limited due to my Java experience.*** By my standards (not yet an evaluation feedback), I take too much time created PRs out of established solutions. The delay I find stems from the inertia I experience when converting my ideas to Java code. Here are the ways in which Competitive Programming in Java addresses it:
- Time limit always makes you write time efficient solutions.
- Critical test data helps you write correct solutions, in one go!
- Further it makes you great at debugging code.
- Hard problems makes you break down the problem into chunks, solve them individually and bring it all together to solve the main problem.

### **Stakeholder**  
- Me - the future of career as a Software Engineer depends on rectifying the issues identified in the [Assumption](#assumption). Executed correctly, my promotion to SE II could be a side effect of this endeavor. As a benefactor and conductor of my journey in CP I must be vigilant about the progress I make.
- HubSpot - problem solving happens at various difficulties throughout the company. Some engineering challenges require more or less use of sophisticated algorithm. Mastery of CP increases my asset value for HubSpot in the long term.
- SalesReporting - my growth as an individual contributor is a benefit to the team in the short term. I am in charge of designing the team API currently. Due to lack of inexperience, it's taking away which could be dedicated to pager duty and other things. Learning to identify edge case helps our team meet the Mainsail requirements. Maintaining our code base becomes easier with solid dev foundations.


### **Risk**  
Competitive Programming at the level at want to perform at requires some time commitment. Consider faster ways to resolve the issue in the assumption.

*Key Performance Indicator (KPI)*  
[Develop Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-Frame (SMART) indicators.](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator) KPIs that satisfy every letter of the SMART acronym are relevant from the start to the end of the project. KPIs that measure progress are necessary, commonly overlooked are KPIs that measure the assumptions. A change in assumption effects the entire goal, positively or negatively. Introduce KPIs for transient assumptions or evaluate and reevaluate the underlying assumptions as you expect them change.

- problem rating - increase in problem rating indicates progress
- time - decrease in time solve problems indicates progress
- commits - an increase in the # commits/week at HubSpot indicates progress
- user rating - the
