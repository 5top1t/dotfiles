# Goal Title

**Start Date:**   

**End Date:**  

**Objective**  
Specify the determined outcome for the goal. Provide background into what made this milestone relaxant.

**Stakeholder:**  
Suppliers, Government, Owners, Investors, Communities, etc. Identity the parties that are related to the goal. Further identify the ones who have influence of the project, vs. the ones who are effected by it. Dig into other complex dynamics at play. Never forget categorization are simplifications for human consumption, the world at play is far more complex and therefor presents far more opportunity. Learn to identify them.

**Resources:**  
Identify the major resources that are unique to this goal and project. Determine the required resources to complete the goal. Recall that resources are split amongst other ongoing goals. Note the gap between the available and the required resources. ***DO NOT*** proceed with the goal without resolving the resource gap. Note all unresolved gap as risk.

**Assumptions:**  
Realize the goal has underlying assumptions. ***DO NOT*** proceed with a goal without listing a set of assumptions. Research all assumptions and bring them to honest conclusions. All inconclusive assumptions form *associated risk.*

**Risk:**  
Evaluate the level of risk you are taking with this goal. Loss of resources (time, finances) is a risk. Consider the stakeholder other milestones.  Collect all that risk and put it on a scale. Game day testing say multiply that risk 2x. Visualize completing this goal under 2x of the measured risk. 

**Call to Action:**  
Form your plan of action.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPI):**  
[Develop Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-Frame (SMART) indicators.](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator) KPIs that satisfy every letter of the SMART acronym are relevant from the start to the end of the project. KPIs that measure progress are necessary, commonly overlooked are KPIs that measure the assumptions. A change in assumption effects the entire goal, positively or negatively. Introduce KPIs for transient assumptions or evaluate and reevaluate the underlying assumptions as you expect them change.
