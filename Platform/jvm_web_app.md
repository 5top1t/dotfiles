# Build a web app with Java


**Backend**

- Design some REST APIs that manage the data the browser will work with
- Set up GitHub source control, a gradle or Maven build script and Jenkins Continuous Integration pipeline
- Build those using Java and Spring Boot. Make the code stateless. Put state into a back end database of some kind
- Add logging and monitoring dashboards
- Build the API service(s) into a Docker container to simplify deployment
- Deploy on a scalable server: Often Amazon ECR + ECS

**Frontend**

- Build a browser UI using React, Angular or Vue and associated tools. Use webpack to package it up with static html and css assets
- Deploy that front end package: possibly using Amazon S3 as a web server
